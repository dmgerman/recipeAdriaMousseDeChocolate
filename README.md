recipeAdriaMousseDeChocolate
============================

This is from Ferran Adria's Family Meal (Spanish version). Yields 6

- 120 ml of whipping cream
- 160 g egg whites (approximately 4)
- 130 g of choocolate (semisweet)
- 1 siphon (0.5L)
- 1 No2 cartridge

(yes, no sugar)

Instructions
------------

- Cut chocolate into small pieces
- Boil cream
- Add to chocolate
- Mix until chocolate has melted
- Wait few minutes for the mixture to cool down (you don't want to cook the whites)
- Add the egg whites and continue to mix until fully incorporated
- Sift the mixture (to make sure the siphon does not clog)
- Load syphon (sift the mix so it does not clog the syphon)
- Charge siphon
- Shake vigourously
- Let is sit for a while at room temperature (say 30 minutes). This step is important. Otherwise the mousse will be runny.
- Shake again, serve

It is recommended to serve it at room temperature but I like it after it has been in the fridge for a while.
